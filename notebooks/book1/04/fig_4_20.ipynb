    " (a) Logistic regression for classifying if an Iris flower is Versicolor ($y=1$) or setosa ($y=0$) using a single input feature $x$ corresponding to sepal length. Labeled points have been (vertically) jittered to avoid overlapping too much. Vertical line is the decision boundary. Generated by [logreg_iris_1d.ipynb](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/04/logreg_iris_1d.ipynb). (b) Same as (a) but showing posterior distribution. Adapted from Figure 4.4 of \\citep{Martin2018}. Generated by [logreg_iris_bayes_1d_pymc3.ipynb](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/04/logreg_iris_bayes_1d_pymc3.ipynb)."
